## Installation

To install all dependencies, open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone github.com/hessamzm/wallet-finder-v3
cd wallet-finder-v3
go run main.go
```

and add txt file from address
for example 

```bash
Address: 395KkubY9rc7Q2gj6QV5cfnvTjLRH31HLz   
Address: 39WbFt9bCDsbCRtknXCXWYSg4oNXh5TkqS

Address: 1GCHdhb7e82RNp9kNLeMSBafdcNrat7Zhf    
```

## Usage

To run the application:
```bash
go run main.go [options]
```
Replace `[options]` with any search criteria you want to use, such as `-location` or `--timestamp`. For example, if we wanted to find wallets based on a specific location and time frame, our command would look like this: `go run main.go -location "Home" --start 2021-04-01T08:30:00Z --end 2021-04-01T17:30:00Z`

## Features

Wallet Finder provides the following features to help users find their lost items quickly and efficiently. The program supports searching based on last known location, timestamp or other criteria as specified by user input history. It also includes a feature for tracking lost items using historical data of where and when they were misplaced in the past.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or new features that could improve Wallet Finder's functionality, please submit an issue on GitHub with a detailed description so we can review it together and make improvements where necessary. To contribute code directly: fork the repository, create your feature branch from `main`, checkout the prune first (`git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master`), then push up to the branch (`git push`).
